General (turned in correctly):
* you deleted the two files 'vectors_new.cpp' and 'vectors_old.cpp' --
  you were not instructed to delete any of your source code.
  -2
  
Optimization (code and commentary):
* assuming your 'vectors.cpp' file is the 'vectors_new.cpp', then not
  all functions have been properly optimized (vector_infnorm and
  vector_dotprod).  I'll note from the instructions: "repeat the
  optimization process until you are certain that the code has been
  sufficiently optimized" 
  -10

* good commentary

Debugging:
* perfect
