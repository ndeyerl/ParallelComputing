General (turned in correctly): looks good
  
Exercise 1:
* uses 'time' command: yes
* names job ex1_surname: yes
* sets input of 10000 primes: yes
* sets the maximum run time to 8 minutes: yes
* sends the standard output to a file ex1_out.txt: yes
* sends the standard error to a file ex1_err.txt: yes
* sends 'all' notifications to SMU email address: yes
  
Exercise 2:
* names job ex2_surname: yes
* sets primes to {300, 3000, 30000}: yes
* redirects output to files run_N.txt where N is # of primes: yes
* specifies a partition name: yes
* sets maximum run time to 15 minutes: yes
* sends stdout to ex2_out.txt: yes
* sends stderr to ex2_err.txt: yes
* sends 'all' notifications to SMU email address: yes
  
Assessing complexity:
* summary information myjob.sh runs: yes
* estimation of overall algorithm complexity: a bit off
* explanation of approach: a bit off
  - You have 7 measurements, so why did you only use two of these to
    estimate the complexity?  From your explanation it's clear that
    you started off trying to use all of the data but couldn't get
    Excel to work correctly (this has been a recurring theme among
    students on this lab).  However, if you'd noticed Excel was off,
    at least you could have computed this slope for a few pairs of
    points and averaged the values...
