Comments on performance:  
* your comments are almost correct; you say that "vectors that are
  especially large in either n or m (compared to the other dimension) 
  cause the computations to take a lot longer" but your data indicates
  otherwise, in that the extreme case of m << n was the fastest of all
  tests.
